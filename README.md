# ðŸŽ® Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax Algorithm)

An **unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game** built in Java using the **Minimax algorithm**. Play against an AI that always makes the best possible move!

## ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Play against an AI opponent  
âœ… AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** for optimal moves  
âœ… Ensures **win or draw**â€”never loses!  
âœ… Command-line interface for easy play  

## ðŸ§  How Minimax Works
The **Minimax algorithm** evaluates all possible moves and selects the one that guarantees the best outcome for the AI:
1. **Scores each move**: +10 for AI win, -10 for AI loss, 0 for draw.  
2. **Simulates all possible game states**.  
3. **Chooses the move** that minimizes the worst-case scenario for AI.  

## ðŸ“œ Game Rules
- The game is played on a **3Ã—3 grid**.  
- **Human ('X')** and **AI ('O')** take turns.  
- The first to get **three in a row** (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.  
- If all cells are filled and no one wins, it's a **draw**.
